developed by: Einar Lielmanis, <einar@beautifier.io>\n    https://beautifier.io/\n\n  Usage:\n    style_html(html_source);\n\n    style_html(html_source, options);\n\n  The options are:\n    indent_inner_html (default false)  — indent <head> and <body> sections,\n    indent_size (default 4)          — indentation size,\n    indent_char (default space)      — character to indent with,\n    wrap_line_length (default 250)            -  maximum amount of characters per line (0 = disable)\n    brace_style (default \"collapse\") - \"collapse\" | \"expand\" | \"end-expand\" | \"none\"\n            put braces on the same line as control statements (default), or put braces on own line (Allman / ANSI style), or just put end braces on own line, or attempt to keep them where they are.\n    inline (defaults to inline tags) - list of tags to be considered inline tags\n    unformatted (defaults to inline tags) - list of tags, that shouldn't be reformatted\n    content_unformatted (defaults to [\"pre\", \"textarea\"] tags) - list of tags, whose content shouldn't be reformatted\n    indent_scripts (default normal)  - \"keep\"|\"separate\"|\"normal\"\n    preserve_newlines (default true) - whether existing line breaks before elements should be preserved\n                                        Only works before elements, not inside tags or for text.\n    max_preserve_newlines (default unlimited) - maximum number of line breaks to be preserved in one chunk\n    indent_handlebars (default false) - format and indent {{#foo}} and {{/foo}}\n    end_with_newline (false)          - end with a newline\n    extra_liners (default [head,body,/html]) -List of tags that should have an extra newline before them.\n\n    e.g.\n\n    style_html(html_source, {\n      'indent_inner_html': false,\n      'indent_size': 2,\n      'indent_char': ' ',\n      'wrap_line_length': 78,\n      'brace_style': 'expand',\n      'preserve_newlines': true,\n      'max_preserve_newlines': 5,\n
